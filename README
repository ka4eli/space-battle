Distributed game, similar to "sea battle". All documentation is in space.pdf
As for now implemented all features, except visual interface. Also added smart autopilot.
To play just follow the REST protocol described in space.pdf.


Although you can use not fully implemented web interface.
Instructions to run it:


1. Launch 2 game instances (you can use JettyLauncher.scala, port config is in application.conf)

2. Send challenge request via SpaceClient.scala sendChallenge

3. To play with AI send auto request to opponent server address via SpaceClient.scala sendAuto

2. In main.js change
    var host = 'localhost';
    var port = 8080;

    to your host and port

3. Got to http://host:port and choose your game id

Now you can choose coordinates and make shot, but you can't see how much cannons you have
